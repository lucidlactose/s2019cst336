                Hello and welcome to a very informal quiz to see how much mathematics
                was retained since your last Calculus course. The question range from
                basic arithmetic to basic antideravitives. Don't feel bad if you cannot
                answer a question and see which answer best suits the question. <em>
                    Note that if the &#982; character symbolizes Pi, but some browsers
                    will display as a lowercase omega with a bar on top.
