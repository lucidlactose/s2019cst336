                <h2> Introduction </h2>
                <p>Welcome to learning about what is essentially dead terminology!</p>
                <p>The phrase C-like is apparently an archaic term nowadays and is slang that is difficult to find anywhere.
                To be intentionally vague, it is used to describe languages that function or look similar to the C programming
                language.I know what you're probably wonder. You're looking at this page and saying "Get on with it! What does it mean
                to be C-like!?" Well I'll tell you.</p>
                <p class="slogan"> C-like means to be like C. </p>

                <br /> <br />
                
                
                <sub><em>"[I]f you don't know what the C programming language is... it is an outgrowth from an earlier language
                that was called B. That's all you need to know about C."</em> <br />
