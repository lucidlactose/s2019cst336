                <h2> What exactly makes a language C-like? </h2>

                <p>It means that most of the functionality provided by C and the syntax within C is present in the language. The idea of being C-like already is a subjective thing. For example, any of the following can make the language qualify as C-Like.
                
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td class = "table-header"><strong> Syntax Rules </strong></td>
                        <td class = "table-header"><strong> Background Rules </strong></td>
                    </tr>

                    <tr>
                        <td> Zero index language</td>
                        <td> Compiling and only compiling</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td> Semicolons and braces </td>
                        <td> Pointers and addresses </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td> Datatype at declaration </td>
                        <td> No mixing datatypes </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>main function</td>
                        <td></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td> import statements </td>
                        <td></td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <br /> <br />
                
                <p> An example for several of these rules working at once can be illustrated by the following screenshot. </p>

                <br /> <br />
                
                <p> This shows the usage of semicolons, braces, main funciton, and importing files.
                    This is a not an exhaustive list of all things that can make a language C-like. Whether or not 
                    you agree all of these rules are in the right sections, these are all attributes present
                    within the C-like languages. If you ever used a language that held at least one of these rules, you
                    can (however innacurately) say the language is C-like. Usually C-like languages hold many of the
                    syntax rules and can hold none of the background rules. You will notice that with each one of these
                    rules that is checked, this C-like language begins to look more and more like C because...
