                <h2>Why Did It Die?</h2>

                <p>Or to be ask a bit more general question. Why did people start using the phrase C-like and why
                    did it lose popularity? Rarely do people ever discuss what it means to be C-like and google searching the term "C-like" 
                    provides a very small amount of results. Wikipedia articles such as the page for the language
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C--">C--</a> starts off with the words, but will not show
                    up explicitly in a Google search. One of the latest results links to a paper released in April 2017
                    titled <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-017-9601-6">"Studentsâ€™ perspective
                    on the first programming language: C-like or Pascal-like languages?"</a> Quite a long name, but it
                    gets the point across that C-like is only for older people if one mentions the language Pascal.
                </p>
                
                <p> Without going into to much detail, C was a very popular language and was very versatile. In terms
                    of paradigms, C is an imperative, procedural language. Internally it was similar to other languages
                    at the time such as Fortran, but was more easily accessible. Procedural languages for a long time
                    looked and functioned very similarly to C, but over time, interpreted languages began to be more
                    popular and more diverse. Although the paradigm is retained, the layout and syntax of these languages
                    deviated from C. Funnily enough, some interpreted languages such as Python use C or C# to interpret.

                    <img width="300" src="img/fibo.jpg" alt="C Fibonacci">
                </figure>
                <p>
                    The above shows the difference of making a function to calculate the fibonacci sequence at any number in the
                    sequence in both Python and C.
                    Now C-like is associated to be almost purely aesethetic because of the popularity of interpreted languages.
                    In other words...
